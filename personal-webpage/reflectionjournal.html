        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            For this first week, I have gained basic knowledge about coding as I wrote for the goal.
            I think the plan I made is useful even though I didn't get to study a specific code language.
            However, it is still the first week, so I don't really worry about that.
            I think I'm at the first step for the goal that I have set for this course.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <p>
            For the second week, I was still working on the webpages and changing the style of the pages. 
            My goal this week was to make my webpages look more beautiful, and I was making some changes to achieve my goal.
            I've learned to change the colors of the background ang the text by using css.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <p>
           During week 3, I learned how to code by javascript and created the hangman game.
           My goal this week was to learn more about js, and I've achieved it.
           The plan I made was helpful to access my goal.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
            This week, I kept working on javascript and learned how to connect Java with HTML.
            Also, I've learned to make animation by javascript.
            These are things that fit my goal on week 4 which is to learn more new things about javascript.
            The plan I've made was helpful for accessing my goal.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p>
            This week, I kept working on javascript and have created the gas simulation and the hidden treasure game.
            I've learned to use event method in javascript which fits my goal.
            My goal for week 5 was to keep working on javascipt and I've accessed that by the plan I made.
