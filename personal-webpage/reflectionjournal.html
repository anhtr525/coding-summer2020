        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <p>
            For this first week, I have gained basic knowledge about coding as I wrote for the goal.
            I think the plan I made is useful even though I didn't get to study a specific code language.
            However, it is still the first week, so I don't really worry about that.
            I think I'm at the first step for the goal that I have set for this course.
